    "## Introduction to clustered data\n",
    "\n",
    "One common reason that data are dependent is that the data values were\n",
    "collected in clusters.  This essentially means that the population was\n",
    "partitioned into groups, a limited number of these groups were somehow\n",
    "selected, and then a limited number of individuals were selected from\n",
    "each of the selected groups.  In a proper survey, there is a\n",
    "well-planned design, in which both the groups, and the individuals\n",
    "within groups, are selected randomly.  The goal in doing this is to\n",
    "maximize the chances that the sample is representative of the\n",
    "population of interest in all relevant ways.  But many other data sets\n",
    "exhibit clustering structure, even when the data collection was not so\n",
    "carefully planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how the clustering in the sample arose, it is likely to\n",
    "be the case that observations within a cluster are more similar to\n",
    "observations in different clusters.  To make this concrete, note that\n",
    "clustering is often geographic.  Data may be collected by visiting\n",
    "several locations, then recruiting participants within each location.\n",
    "People within a location may share similarities, for example in\n",
    "demography and lifestyle, or they may share environmental\n",
    "circumstances such as climate.  When we have clustered data, it is\n",
    "usually advisable to account for this in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering structure in NHANES\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed process of collecting data for a study like NHANES is\n",
    "very complex, so we will simplify things substantially here.  Roughly\n",
    "speaking, in NHANES the data are collected by selecting a limited\n",
    "number of counties in the US, then selecting subregions of these\n",
    "counties, then selecting people within these subregions.  Since\n",
    "counties are geographically constrained, it is expected that people\n",
    "within a county are more similar to each other than they are to people\n",
    "in other counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we could obtain the county id where each NHANES participant resides, we could\n",
    "directly study this clustering structure.  However for privacy reasons\n",
    "this information is not released with the data.  Instead, we have\n",
    "access to \"masked variance units\" (MVUs), which are formed by\n",
    "combining subregions of different counties into artificial groups that\n",
    "are not geographically contiguous.  While the MVUs are not the actual\n",
    "clusters of the survey, and are not truly contiguous geographic\n",
    "regions, they are deliberately selected to mimic these things, while\n",
    "minimizing the risk that a subject can be \"unmasked\" in the data.  For\n",
    "the remainder of this notebook, we will treat the MVUs as clusters,\n",
    "and explore the extent to which they induce correlations in some of\n",
    "the NHANES variables that we have been studying.\u0013\n",
    "\n",
    "The MVU identifiers can be obtained by combining the `SDMVSTRA` and\n",
    "`SDMVPSU` identifiers, which we do next:"
