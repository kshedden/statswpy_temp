    "## Introduction to clustered data\n",
    "\n",
    "One common reason that data are dependent is that the data values\n",
    "were collected in clusters.  This essentially means that the population\n",
    "was partitioned into groups, a limited number of these groups were\n",
    "somehow selected, and then a limited number of individuals were\n",
    "selected from each of the selected groups.  In a proper survey, there is\n",
    "a well-planned design, in which both the groups, and the individuals within\n",
    "groups, are selected randomly.  The goal in doing this is to maximize\n",
    "the chances that the sample is representative of the population of interest\n",
    "in all relevant ways.  But many other data sets exhibit\n",
    "clustering structure, even when the data collection was not so\n",
    "carefully planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of how the clustering in the sample arose, it is likely to be\n",
    "the case that observations within a cluster are more similar to observations\n",
    "in different clusters.  To make this concrete, note that clustering is\n",
    "often geographic.  Data may be collected by visiting several locations, then\n",
    "recruiting participants within each location.  People within a location\n",
    "may share similarities, for example in demography and lifestyle, or they may\n",
    "share environmental circumstances such as climate.  When\n",
    "we have clustered data, it is usually advisable to account for this in the\n",
    "analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clustering structure in NHANES\n",
    "\n",
    "The detailed process of collecting data for a study like\n",
    "NHANES is very complex, so we will simplify things substantially here.\n",
    "Roughly speaking, in NHANES the data are collected by selecting a limited number of\n",
    "counties in the US,\n",
    "then selecting subregions of these counties, then selecting people within\n",
    "these subregions.  Since counties are geographically constrained, it is\n",
    "expected that people within a county are more similar to each other than they\n",
    "are to people in other counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we could obtain the county id for each\n",
    "NHANES participant, we could directly study this clustering structure.  However\n",
    "for privacy reasons this information is not released with the data.  Instead, we have\n",
    "access to \"masked variance units\" (MVUs), which are formed by combining subregions\n",
    "of different counties into artificial groups that are not geographically\n",
    "contiguous.  While the MVUs are not the actual clusters of the survey,\n",
    "and are not truly contiguous geographic regions, they are deliberately\n",
    "selected to mimic\n",
    "these things, while minimizing the risk that a subject can be \"unmasked\"\n",
    "in the data.  For the remainder of this notebook, we will treat the MVUs\n",
    "as clusters, and explore the extent to which they induce correlations\n",
    "in some of the NHANES variables that we have been studying.\u0013\n",
    "\n",
    "The MVU identifiers can be obtained by combining the `SDMVSTRA` and `SDMVPSU`\n",
    "identifiers, which we do next:"

    "## Intraclass correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity among observations within a cluster can be measured using a statistic\n",
    "called the *intraclass correlation*, or ICC.  This is a distinct form of\n",
    "correlation from Pearson's correlation.  It takes on values from 0 to 1, with\n",

    "identical, and 0 corresponding to \"perfect independence\" -- the mean value\n",

    "\n",
    "We can assess ICC using two regression techniques, marginal regression, and multilevel\n",
