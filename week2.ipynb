    "When there are multiple covariates, it is hard to assess whether\n",
    "the variance is uniform throughout this range, but we can easily check\n",
    "for a \"mean/variance relationship\", in which the variance either increases\n",
    "or decreases with the mean.  The plot of residuals on fitted values\n",
    "is used to assess whether a mean/variance relationship is present."
